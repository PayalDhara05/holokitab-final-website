                <h1>How much screen time is healthy for my child? The new era of eLearning</h1>
                <p>Most of us try to get our children rid of mobile phones, don't we? It's not wrong.<span class="blog-highlight"> Too much</span> screen time may lead to several problems in children. But before you make any decision, please focus on the word “Too much”. The pandemic has changed the world and hit the traditional education system at its core. Schools have been temporarily closed,and we all, in some way, have moved to eLearning. eLearning was there before, but the pace has grown. It's here to stay.</p>
                <h2 class="h2-header">Healthy Screen Time: Time restrictions for children</h2>
                <p>When we talk about healthy screen time, it's mostly referred to as timing, for how long is it ideal for a child towatch the screen (mobiles/TV/computer/tab..etc.). While limiting time is a crucial factor, making the screen time educational can actually make it healthy. According to experts:<br><br>1) <span class="blog-highlight">Children aged below 18 months</span> should avoid any screen time except video calls with family.<br>2) <span class="blog-highlight">Children aged 18-24 months</span> can have a minimumeducational screen time, provided there's someone to look after them when they are using mobile/watching TV.<br>3) <span class="blog-highlight">For children aged 2-6</span> ,1-2hour on a weekday and 3 hours ontheweekend is good.</p>
                <h2 class="h2-header">Educational Screen Time -Doing it the healthy way</h2>
                <p>With proper supervision,i.e.,focusing on academics and limiting screen time, you can make your child's screen time healthy. Engaging children in educational screen time can help them in many ways:<br></br>1) Improve motor skills and coordination<br>2) Gamified learning has a powerful impact on the brain: Faster and better understandability<br>3) Help in improving communication.</p>
                <h2 class="h2-header">How can HoloKitab help you?</h2>
                <p>We embed Augmented Reality in Textbooks. This technology can help your child understand and adapt faster to educational concepts with the power of 3d Visualization. The gamified learningmakes their screen time educational and thus healthy.<span class="blog-highlight"> While learning through a powerful 3D gamified technique, children are also using their textbooks. Interaction with objects in the books will help develop their cognitive ability.</span></p>
